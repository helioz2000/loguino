APRS Telemetry logging with Arduino (for licensed hams only)

__NOTE:__ This project is a work in progress and the stated 
functionality is not achieved yet.

Use the APRS Telemetry fucntionality to log data.
This project was initially designed to be installed with repeater VK3RHO
to log the TX radio temperature of the trasnmitter in the Yaesu repeater.

Hardware:
- Arduino Nano
- Temperature MCP9808 (I2C bus)
- Any HAM radio

The design is derived from trackuino software.
